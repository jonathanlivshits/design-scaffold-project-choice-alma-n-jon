        <h4 class="article-description">Our friend had these delicacies shipped in from a patisserie located in Korea. She bought us three boxes of these goodies and each one of them had a different flavor. We had a selection of chocolate, vanilla, orange creamsicle, lemon, strawberry, and pistachio. We enjoyed these macarons with some freshly brewed earl grey tea and they were delicious! The sweetness of the desserts mixed with the light smoothness of the tea created a beautiful flavor. My favorite one was the lemon macaron while Jonâ€™s was the strawberry flavor. We had a nice experience with these desserts and will for sure have more imported from Korea. 10/10!!</h4>
