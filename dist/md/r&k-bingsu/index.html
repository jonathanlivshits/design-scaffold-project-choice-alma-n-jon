    <p>Wow! I cannot describe how adorable and scrumptious this Bingsu was. Jon and I decided to visit a cute-themed dessert shop while we were strolling around in Brooklyn and it did not disappoint. We ordered the Rilakkuma and Korilakkuma Bingsu, their bestsellers. The sweet flavors meshed well with the ice and were not too overwhelming. To our surprise, even after a while, the ice in the dessert did not melt and actually held up its original shape. The presentation of the Bingsu was aesthetically pleasing and the white chocolate pieces perfectly topped off the chilly ice. Itâ€™s an 8.5/10 from us!</p>
