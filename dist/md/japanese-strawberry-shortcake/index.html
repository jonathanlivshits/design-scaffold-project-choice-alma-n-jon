    <p>Today, November 8, <strong>IS OUR BIRTHDAYS</strong>!! We celebrated it together by going to have some afternoon tea and it was delectable. The star of the show was the Japanese Strawberry Shortcake, accompanied by the freshly-brewed Rosehip tea. The cake was held together by softly whipped cream with strawberries in between each layer. On the top of it was a bright red ripe strawberry with a pleasant proportion between sweet and sour. When I tell you I savored every last bite of this cake and even scraped the plate for more... Absolutely no complaints and one of the best desserts Jon and I enjoyed together. 10/10!!</p>
