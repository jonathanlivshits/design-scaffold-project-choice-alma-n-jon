    <p>Honestly, I expected more from this crème caramel. I saw a review about it online stating that it was the “best crème caramel they’ve ever had,” but I just don’t understand the hype. It looked pretty appetizing, topped off with light whipped cream and maraschino cherry and surrounded by warm caramel sauce. However, it tasted bland, excessively sweet, and artificial. The pudding fell apart the second I put my spoon into it, which disappointed me greatly. I was looking forward to this for the past week and it broke my heart since it deteriorated so quickly. To put it simply, this crème caramel was bad. 2/10.</p>
