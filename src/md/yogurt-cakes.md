description: Alma and I visited this cafe in Manhattan that sold cute little yogurt cakes in transparent square containers. We heard a lot of good things about the cafe, so we were particularly excited to try their cakes. We bought two different flavors; I got the strawberry one and Alma got the blueberry one since they were the most popular items on their menu. Both of the yogurt cakes we bought were extremely creamy, light, delicate, and not overly sweet. The cake paired with the fresh berries made me feel refreshed (especially the strawberry one). Sometimes, yogurt cakes have a more dense, chewier texture due to over mixing the batter. However, these yogurt cakes were not dense at all. Overall, we would rate this cafe a 9/10 from the two items that we tried. All of the flavors compliment each other harmoniously. I would definitely recommend this spot to everyone, even those who donâ€™t have a sweet tooth.
